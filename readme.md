# Recipe Manager

## About the project

This is a terminal application for managing recipes. A user can view recipes from a pool of recipes.
The user can also generate a weekly meal plan with a recipe for each day. 
Another type of app user, a dietitian, can add recipes to the recipe pool and edit them while s/he can also
view recipes from the recipe pool.

The app saves all recipes and the user's recipe weeks to  and reads them from the files recipes.txt and recipeWeeks.txt.
These files are in the 'assets' directory.

### Java SDK version

17.0.2 (build 17.0.2 + 8)

## How to run

Create a jar -file and place the assets folder in the same folder with it. 
Then run the program from the command line with the command java -jar RecipeManager.jar.


## Product backlog and UML diagrams

While creating this project I have practiced the agile work process.
I have created **user stories** with their **acceptance criteria** and **tasks** in an Excel document.
This list can be found in the document **'Product backlog.pdf'** in the **'Project organisation'** directory.

I have also made **a UML use case diagram** and **UML class diagrams**. These too are in the 'Project organisation' directory.
